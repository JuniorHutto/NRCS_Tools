# Calculate Geometry Tool (Area)

## Objective: Create a tool that creates a Field [ACRES] and calculate acres in each polygon

### Steps

1.Open attribute table for layer you want determine the acres
2.Select the layer in pick box
3.Run
4.Check table for [ACRES] field
5.If add another polygon Run tools again

# Calculate Geometry Tool (Length)

## Objective: Create a tool that creates a Field [FEET] and calculate acres in each polyline

### Steps

1.Open attribute table for layer you want determine the acres
2.Select the layer in pick box
3.Run
4.Check table for [FEET] field and records
5.If add another polyline run tools again
6.It will work with a polygon if need know length of bondary
